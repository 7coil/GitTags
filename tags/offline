At MedalBot Inc, we pride in bots that are high quality, functional, and useful to our end users. When going through the application process, bots are required to uphold our values, and provide the exemplary service that we, and users expect from us. One of these factors is whether or not the bot is online or not. When a bot is online, a moderator from our team can be tested for our values, and can be checked for flaws that may hurt the integrity of the bot, such as the leakage of a token, commands that may go against our or the Discord Developer API and Discord Terms of Service, etc. Being online also allows for end users of your bot, which we infer you may want, as youâ€™re posting your bot here, to actually use the bot in question.
