GitHub is a brilliant way of sharing and collaborating on Free and Open Source Software. Such online services allow users to trust, bring extra features, inspect, learn from, etc. from your Discord bot. However, GitHub (and Git) in general are flawed in that one may accidentally push secrets. A lot of your code likely relies on interacting with services such as the Discord API. These services require the use of unique, multiple use secrets, which have to be loaded in the code, known as a “token”. As a result, it may be easy to accidentally push such secrets onto GitHub. Please avoid development practices that rely on hard-coded credentials in your code, and avoid pushing the configuration file onto GitHub. Your bot has been declined as a result of this, even if your token has been "deleted" from GitHub, as previous commits still hold your information. Please keep these secrets secret, and reset your token at the latest. Not resetting your token leaves your Discord Bot vulnerable to misuse by unauthorised users. Please look into ways to prevent this in the future, such as awslabs/git-secrets or using the .gitignore file to ignore your configuration file.
