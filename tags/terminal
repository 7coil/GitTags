_I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Terminal, is in fact, ls.terminal.ink, or as I've recently taken to calling it, the "Terminal.ink Bot List". Terminal is not a bot list unto itself, but is rather another free component of a fully functioning community made useful by Terminal.ink._

_Many users use a modified version of the Terminal Bot List software every day, without realising it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of ls.terminal.ink, which is widely used today is often called Terminal, and many users are not aware that it is basically the Terminal Bot List, developed by Terminal.ink_

_The Terminal Bot List is really a part of Terminal.ink, and these people are using it, but it is just part of the community they partake in. Terminal.ink is an essential part of the community, which has other useful services such as a paint program, API for bots, and more. Saying Terminal while meaning the bot list is confusing to others._
