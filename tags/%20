Space: what is it?
The simple answer is, we don't know.
Or at least we didn't know until now.
Hello, I'm Douglas Reynholm, and I'm not a scientist, but I do have a better understanding of what space is than any scientist living today.
Where did I gain these insights?
From this man, the founder of Spaceology.
Beth Gaga Shaggy — no relation to Lady Gaga or Shaggy — is the founder of Spaceology, a religion, not a cult.
In other words, when it comes to space, he's the man with his head screwed on tight.
This is what he told me when I met him on holiday two weeks ago.
